# Elevvo Internship Projects

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains 4 Machine Learning projects completed as part of my **Elevvo Internship**.  
Each task covers a different ML problem and demonstrates data processing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization skills.

### Tasks Overview
| Task | Description | Key Techniques / Models | Results / Notes |
|------|-------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| [Task 1: Student Score Prediction](Task1_StudentScorePrediction/README.md) | Predict students' exam scores based on study hours | Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression | Polynomial Regression: MAE 0.27, R² 0.99 |
| [Task 2: Customer Segmentation](Task2_CustomerSegmentation/README.md) | Cluster mall customers into segments based on demographics and spending | K-Means, Silhouette Score, Power BI dashboard | 5 clusters: Cautious Wealthy, Moderate, Luxury Spenders, Impulsive, Budget-Conscious |
| [Task 3: Loan Approval Prediction](Task3_LoanApprovalPrediction/README.md) | Predict loan approval status | Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, Orange Data Mining workflow | Random Forest: 99.88% accuracy |
| [Task 4: Sales Forecasting](Task4_SalesForecasting/README.md) | Forecast future Walmart sales | Regression (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost), ARIMA, Modified ARIMA, SARIMA | Forecasts visualized and compared with actual sales |

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels  
- Orange Data Mining (Task 3)  
- Power BI (Task 2 Dashboard)

## 🔗 Notes
- Datasets are not included if large; links to Kaggle datasets are provided in each task README.  
- Each task folder contains: notebook(s), data (optional or sample), and any dashboards/workflows.  
- Task 4 is focused on **time series forecasting**, while other tasks cover regression, classification, and clustering.
