# Task 4: Sales Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **forecasting future sales** using historical Walmart sales data.  
The goal is to analyze sales patterns, engineer time-based features, and apply regression models and time-series methods to predict upcoming sales trends.  

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: [Walmart Sales Forecast Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast)  
- Features include store-level weekly sales, dates, and related attributes.  
- Target variable: **Weekly Sales**

## 🔄 Project Pipeline
1. **Data Visualization & EDA**  
   - Explored sales patterns over time  
   - Identified missing values and outliers  
   - Cleaned and prepared data for modeling  

2. **Prediction (Regression Models)**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - XGBoost Regressor  

3. **Forecasting (Time Series Models)**  
   - ARIMA  
   - Modified ARIMA  
   - SARIMA  

4. **Evaluation & Visualization**  
   - Compared model results  
   - Plotted **Actual vs. Predicted Sales** to assess accuracy  

## 📊 Covered Topics
- Time Series Forecasting  
- Regression Models  
- Feature Engineering for Temporal Data  
- Comparative Model Evaluation  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
